                <p>Cannamei is currently under construction, our website is dedicated to the discussion of medical cannabis<br>
                    <br>
                    We don't remove posts, ban or censor people because they hold a different opinion or are new to the discussion of medical cannabis<br>
                    <br>
                    Cannamei will be a lightly moderated forum. Extremely overmoderated forums such as reddit
                    censor people for little to no reason. Being a member of this forum means you won't have to worry about overzealous moderators removing your posts 
                    or you being shadow banned without your knowledge. 
                    <br><br>
                    Cannamei is open source, open discussion and a place for everybody<br>
                    <br>
                    If you would like to help work on Cannamei, please send an email to: info@cannamei.com
